## Variables
* Variable types cannot be mutated
* redifining variables with the same name is possible

## Functions
* We can skip keyword return
* function example fn fn_name() -> returnType{
    let type = String::from("type");
    type
}

* Inline functions are quick one liners, used in specia scope accessing
* variables can point to the address of inline functions and can be used the same way as the inline function
* functions can be passed as input to other functions

## Structs

## Collectibles
* iters are consumable

## Optionals


## Error handling

## Lifetimes
* handling reference inside the stack
* defining that the memory address will live inside the heap as long as the object exists

## Traits
* shared functionality and behaviour
* similar to interfaces

## Pointers
* stack is lifo 
* heap is random access

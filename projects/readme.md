## 1. Basic Auth App

This project is a simple Rust application that demonstrates basic authentication using the `reqwest` crate. It performs an HTTP GET request to a specified URL with basic authentication headers.

## 2. Basic Chat App

A basic TCP chat application in Rust that demonstrates non-blocking I/O operations and message broadcasting to multiple clients using TCP sockets and multithreading.

## 3. CSV Reader

This project reads data from a CSV file and prints the records to the console. It uses the `csv` crate for reading CSV files.

## 4. File Compressor

A Rust application that compresses files using the `flate2` crate for gzip compression. It reads an input file, compresses it, and writes the compressed data to an output file.

## 5. Image Downloader

This project downloads an image from a specified URL and saves it to a temporary directory. It uses the `reqwest` crate for making HTTP requests and the `tempfile` crate for creating temporary files.

## 6. JSON App

A simple Rust application that parses a JSON string into a Rust struct and prints the parsed data. It uses the `serde` and `serde_json` crates for JSON serialization and deserialization.

## 7. Link Extractor

This project fetches the HTML content of a webpage and extracts all the links from it. It uses the `reqwest` crate for making HTTP requests and the `select` crate for parsing HTML.

## 8. MongoDB App

A Rust application that connects to a MongoDB database, performs a ping operation to check the connection, and lists all the databases. It uses the `mongodb` crate for interacting with MongoDB.

## 9. Notes App

This project allows you to add timestamped notes to a text file. It reads a note from the command line arguments and appends it to a file along with the current timestamp.

## 10. Postgres App

A Rust application that connects to a PostgreSQL database and creates tables for storing customer and product information. It uses the `postgres` crate for database interactions.

## 11. SQLite App

This project connects to a SQLite database, creates a schema if it doesn't exist, and inserts data into the database. It uses the `sqlx` crate for interacting with SQLite.

## 12. Car Inventory Project

A Rust application that fetches data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) API to list all vehicle manufacturers and allows searching through them. It uses the `reqwest` crate for making HTTP requests and `serde_json` for handling JSON data.
